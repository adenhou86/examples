You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. I have a table that was extracted from a PDF with `pdftotext -layout`, which preserves spacing and indentation but not an actual table structure. Please convert the text below into a well-formatted Markdown table.

1. Preserve the row/column structure as closely as possible.
2. Make sure column headers and sub-headers are formatted appropriately.
3. Do not include any extra commentaryâ€”only return the final Markdown table.
4. If there are numeric values (including negatives), ensure they are copied accurately.

Here is the text to convert (enclosed in triple backticks):
