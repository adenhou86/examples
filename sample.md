**Project Overview:**
The intern will work on enhancing and optimizing an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform Question & Answering (Q&A) on publicly available financial documents. The pipeline involves several key components, including document parsing, text chunking, retrieval, and re-ranking. The goal is to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of the pipeline, ensuring it delivers high-quality, contextually relevant answers to complex financial queries.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **Document Parsing:** The intern will work on improving the parsing of financial documents to extract structured data and text. This may involve handling various document formats (PDFs, HTML, etc.) and ensuring the extracted content is clean and usable for downstream tasks.
  
- **Text Chunking:** The intern will explore and implement advanced text chunking strategies to break down large documents into smaller, semantically meaningful segments. This is crucial for improving the retrieval and relevance of information during the Q&A process.

- **Retrieval Mechanisms:** The intern will experiment with and optimize retrieval mechanisms to ensure the most relevant document chunks are retrieved for a given query. This may involve working with vector databases, embedding models, and similarity search algorithms.

- **Re-ranking Models:** The intern will focus on improving the re-ranking of retrieved documents to ensure the most relevant information is prioritized. This could involve fine-tuning existing models or implementing new re-ranking strategies.

- **Tooling & Frameworks:** The intern will primarily use Python, along with frameworks like Langchain and LangGraph, to implement and test their solutions. They will also work with SQL for data management and querying.

**Expectations:**
- The intern is expected to have a strong foundation in Python programming and a good understanding of natural language processing (NLP) concepts.
- They should be proactive in researching and implementing state-of-the-art techniques in document parsing, retrieval, and re-ranking.
- The intern should be able to work independently but also collaborate effectively with the team, providing regular updates and seeking feedback.
- By the end of the internship, the intern should deliver a well-documented and optimized pipeline component, along with a report summarizing their findings and recommendations for future improvements.


**Technical Skills:**
- **Advanced NLP Techniques:** The intern will gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge NLP techniques, particularly in the context of RAG pipelines, including document parsing, text chunking, retrieval, and re-ranking.
  
- **Python Programming:** The intern will further develop their Python skills, particularly in using libraries and frameworks like Langchain and LangGraph, which are essential for building and optimizing LLM-based applications.

- **Data Management with SQL:** The intern will gain experience in managing and querying structured data using SQL, which is crucial for handling large datasets in financial applications.

- **Machine Learning & AI:** The intern will deepen their understanding of machine learning and AI, particularly in the context of fine-tuning models and optimizing retrieval and re-ranking processes.

**Professional Skills:**
- **Problem-Solving:** The intern will develop strong problem-solving skills by tackling complex challenges related to document processing and information retrieval.
  
- **Research & Innovation:** The intern will learn how to research and implement state-of-the-art techniques, fostering a mindset of innovation and continuous improvement.

- **Collaboration & Communication:** The intern will enhance their ability to work in a team, communicate technical concepts effectively, and present their findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

- **Project Management:** The intern will gain experience in managing a project from inception to completion, including setting goals, meeting deadlines, and delivering high-quality results.
