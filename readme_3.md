### **What is the "As of Date" of a Financial Report in a 10-K or 10-Q?**
The **"As of Date"** for a financial report in a **10-K** or **10-Q** refers to the **end date of the reporting period** covered by the financial statements in the filing. It represents the **cutoff date** for the financial data presented.

#### **Where to Find the "As of Date" in a 10-K or 10-Q?**
You can find the **"As of Date"** in the following locations within the filing:

1. **Financial Statements Section (Balance Sheet)**
   - The balance sheet will explicitly mention **"As of"** a specific date.
   - Example from a **10-K**:
     ```
     Consolidated Balance Sheets
     As of December 31, 2023 and 2022
     ```
   - Example from a **10-Q**:
     ```
     Consolidated Balance Sheets
     (Unaudited)
     As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022
     ```

2. **Cover Page of the Filing**
   - The **cover page** of the 10-K/10-Q often includes the fiscal period end date.
   - Example wording:
     ```
     For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (10-K)
     For the quarter ended September 30, 2023 (10-Q)
     ```

3. **Managementâ€™s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) Section**
   - In **Item 7 (10-K) or Item 2 (10-Q)**, the **MD&A** section typically states the financial reporting period covered.
   - Example:
     ```
     The following discussion and analysis covers our financial performance for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and compares it to prior periods.
     ```

4. **Header or Footer of Financial Statements**
   - Some filings include a reference to the **"As of Date"** in footnotes or headers.

5. **EDGAR Metadata / XBRL Data (Machine-Readable Format)**
   - If youâ€™re using **automated extraction**, you can find the **"As of Date"** in the **XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) tags** associated with the filing.

### **Key Differences Between 10-K and 10-Q "As of Date"**
| **Filing** | **As of Date (Financial Report Cutoff Date)** | **Frequency** | **Example** |
