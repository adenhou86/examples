1. User Query Rewriting and Expansion

    Automatic Query Reformulation
        Use an LLM to rephrase the user’s query, adding synonyms, related terms, and specific financial expressions (e.g., via a financial thesaurus).
        Goal: Capture different ways of referencing the same concept (“equity financing” vs. “common stock issuance”), improving retrieval accuracy.

    Contextual Expansion
        Detect details in the user’s query (e.g., company name, date range, specific risk type) and then reformulate the query to include those details when appropriate.
        For instance, if the user asks, “What are the main funding sources for Company X?,” you could expand it to “What are the main funding sources for Company X in the 2021 10-K report?”

2. User’s Query Intent Comprehension / Decomposition

    Task Detection
        Implement a module (either via fine-tuning or prompt engineering) that classifies the query to determine its nature:
            Data extraction (e.g., looking for precise numbers or ratios)
            Summarization (e.g., summarizing risks, business model)
            Table extraction (i.e., retrieving or parsing tables from documents)
        This module then routes the query to the correct sub-pipeline (a data-extraction pipeline vs. a summarization pipeline, etc.).

    Decomposing Complex Queries
        Some user queries are multi-part (“Provide me with the leverage ratio and a summary of the risk factors…”).
        Use an “agentic” approach (with an LLM or an orchestrator) that breaks the query into multiple questions or steps, solves each sub-task, and finally combines all answers into one.

3. Retrieval Based on Search Query + Contextual Retrieval

    Contextualize the Query
        Automatically extract contextual cues (company name, ISIN code, time period, industry, etc.) and use them to filter or boost document scores.
        For example, if the question is about “Tesla in 2022,” only retrieve chunks from Tesla’s 2022 documents.

    Reordering Documents/Chunks According to Query Type
        If the query requests “financial metrics extraction,” prioritize searching within table-like sections or “Financial Statements” rather than purely narrative sections.

4. Multimodal RAG

    Integration of Visual Elements
        Many EDGAR filings contain financial tables and statements as embedded PDFs, images, or HTML tables.
        Incorporate an OCR/table parser to convert these tables into structured data (CSV, JSON) so they can be searched or retrieved.
        Then combine text-based retrieval with structured data retrieval for more comprehensive results.

    Agentic PDF Navigation
        A specialized module that can “navigate” through PDFs, detect textual vs. visual sections, combine text analysis (LLM) with numeric extraction (table parser), and produce a unified answer.

5. Retrieving the Right Document Set Based on User Query

    Semantic and Metadata-Based Filtering
        Use an index or metadata tags (date, document type, company ticker) to narrow down the search space for higher relevance.
        For example, if the question is about an annual report, limit retrieval to 10-K documents from the desired time period.

    Multi-Document RAG / Agentic Behavior
        Merge relevant information from multiple documents.
        Determine if the question needs data from different sources (10-K, 10-Q, Prospectus) and gather them accordingly.
        The agent can first search the 10-K, then refine with the 10-Q, etc.

6. Context Filtering Based on Query-to-Doc Embedding Scores

    Dual Filtering (Dense + BM25) or Cross-Encoder for fine-grained re-ranking of top-k results.
    Coherence Scoring
        Beyond simple semantic similarity, incorporate a “coherence” or “confidence” score. Some passages may be topically similar but not actually answer the question.
        A lightweight classifier or a “verification” LLM can filter out irrelevant chunks.

7. Multi-Columns Detection

    Parsing Multi-Column PDFs
        Identify the correct reading order in multi-column PDFs to avoid text

Here’s a concise breakdown of improvements you can implement to boost the overall accuracy of your RAG pipeline, focusing on each stage from query understanding to answer generation:
1. Query Understanding & Expansion

    Automatic Query Reformulation
        Use an LLM to rephrase and enrich the user query with synonyms, related terms, and domain-specific (financial) vocabulary.
        Benefit: Increases recall by covering various expressions for the same concept.

    Intent Detection & Task Classification
        Identify if the user wants data extraction, summarization, table extraction, etc.
        Benefit: Helps you route the query to the right sub-pipeline (e.g., specialized module for numbers vs. a summarization module).

    Contextual Query Expansion
        If the query references a specific company, date, or sector, add those details explicitly to the query for retrieval filtering.
        Benefit: Avoids searching irrelevant documents.

2. Advanced Chunking Strategies

    Semantic Chunking
        Instead of splitting strictly by page, segment text by topic, section headers, or paragraphs.
        Benefit: More coherent chunks, better retrieval relevance.

    Sliding Window / Overlapping Chunks
        If each chunk is 300 tokens, overlap them by ~50-100 tokens to avoid cutting off important sentences.
        Benefit: Preserves context at chunk boundaries.

    Late Chunking / Late Interaction
        Identify relevant sections first, then chunk them.
        Benefit: Reduces noise and ensures meaningful segments.

3. Retrieval Enhancements

    Hybrid Retrieval Tuning
        Adjust weighting between dense (embeddings) and sparse (BM25) retrievers, or try more advanced weighting/combination approaches.
        Benefit: Finds an optimal balance between exact keyword matching and semantic matching.

    Domain-Specific Embeddings
        Consider financial domain embeddings (e.g., FinBERT) instead of general-purpose embeddings, if available and well-trained.
        Benefit: Better handles finance-specific terms and nuances.

    Metadata-Aware Filtering
        Leverage document metadata (date, company ticker, report type) to filter or boost ranking.
        Benefit: Reduces the search space and increases accuracy for targeted queries.

    Vector Stores / Specialized Indexes
        Use dedicated vector databases (e.g., Milvus, Weaviate) or hybrid search engines (Elasticsearch with dense vector capabilities).
        Benefit: Scalable, more powerful retrieval and ranking options.

4. Re-Ranking & Context Filtering

    Cross-Encoder Re-Ranking
        Apply a cross-encoder (e.g., “cross-encoder/ms-marco-*”) to re-score top-N chunks more precisely.
        Benefit: Cross-encoders often yield higher accuracy than simple bi-encoders.

    Context Filtering with a Classifier
        Before feeding chunks to the LLM, use a specialized classifier (or a small LLM) to verify if each chunk truly addresses the query.
        Benefit: Eliminates off-topic chunks, improving final answer quality.

    Deduplication & Consistency Checks
        Remove near-duplicate chunks and ensure no contradictory passages are selected.
        Benefit: Decreases redundancy and potential confusion in the final answer.

5. Augmented Prompt & Answer Generation

    Prompt Engineering
        Provide clear instructions on how the LLM should use the chunks (e.g., “Use only these chunks to answer,” “Cite the source text,” etc.).
        Benefit: Ensures the LLM stays focused on the provided context.

    Summarization of Top Chunks
        If you have many chunks, summarize them (using a smaller model) before the final LLM step.
        Benefit: Keeps within token limits and provides a concise context.

    Chain of Thought & Structured Output
        Prompt the LLM to reason step-by-step and possibly return the reasoning (if needed) or a structured answer (bullet points, tables, etc.).
        Benefit: Improves clarity and can help debug or validate the answer.

6. Beyond Text: Multimodal / Table Extraction

    Table & Footnote Parsing
        For financial reports containing tables, parse them into a structured format (CSV, JSON) for direct querying.
        Benefit: More accurate data extraction (especially for numeric queries).

    Link Footnotes to Main Text
        Include footnotes’ content alongside the relevant chunk (e.g., footnote references in 10-K).
        Benefit: Important clarifications are preserved, improving semantic context.

    Multimodal Integration (PDF Text + Images/Tables)
        If the documents are scanned or have embedded images, use OCR to capture all text and structured data.
        Benefit: Increases coverage for all relevant content in the reports.

7. Continuous Evaluation & Feedback Loop

    Create a Financial Q&A Test Set
        Develop a benchmark of realistic finance questions and measure retrieval & answer accuracy.
        Benefit: Enables systematic improvement tracking.

    A/B Testing
        Compare results of different chunking strategies, embeddings, and re-rankers on real-world queries.
        Benefit: Ensures empirical validation of each modification.

    Human-in-the-Loop Feedback
        Encourage domain experts to validate or correct answers, then iterate model tuning.
        Benefit: Incorporates real-world expertise, improving reliability.

Conclusion

By refining query understanding, employing smarter chunking, boosting the retrieval and re-ranking stages, and carefully orchestrating how you prompt the LLM, you’ll achieve significant gains in accuracy. Integrating table extraction for financials, linking footnotes, and doing continuous evaluations are also key to making your RAG pipeline more powerful and domain-tailored.
