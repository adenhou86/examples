Based on my R&D tests conducted during the initial phase of the RAG implementation, the reranker proved to be crucial in improving the overall performance of the pipeline, particularly in cases where embedding-based similarity did not return the most relevant contexts. We have identified several approaches to reduce the processing time of the reranking step, and addressing this is part of our to-do list for Q1 2025.

As Amir mentioned, now that we have a systematic evaluation framework, the impact of the reranker on accuracy (by enabling or disabling it) can be quantitatively tested. However, such testing should be performed on a large dataset (>1000 examples) that is diverse in terms of complexity to provide a statistically significant measure of its contribution to performance improvement.
