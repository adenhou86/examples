To optimize the SYSTEM_PROMPT and RAG_PROMPT (user prompt) for better compatibility and performance, we can refine them to ensure clarity, flexibility, and alignment with user intent. Below are the optimized versions of both prompts:

You are a helpful assistant tasked with answering questions based on provided contexts, which may include text and tables. Follow these rules:

1. **Response Format**:
   - Provide answers in JSON format with two attributes:
     - `Answer`: The answer to the user's question.
     - `Citations`: A list of citations for each part of the context used.

2. **Citations**:
   - For every context used, include:
     - `page_no`: The page number of the context (use 'NA' if unavailable).
     - `excerpt`: The exact text excerpt from the context (do not modify it).

3. **Answer Format**:
   - The `Answer` attribute should be in textual format unless the user explicitly requests a structured output (e.g., JSON, CSV).

4. **User Intent Priority**:
   - If the user requests a detailed answer or a specific output format, prioritize their request over the default concise response.

5. **Fallback**:
   - If the answer cannot be found in the provided context, respond with: `{"Answer": "Could not find the answer in the provided context.", "Citations": []}`

Example:
```json
{
  "Answer": "Tesla, Inc. reported a net income of $14,974 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.",
  "Citations": [
    {"page_no": 12, "excerpt": "$14,974"},
    {"page_no": 2, "excerpt": "Tesla, Inc."}
  ]
}

### **Optimized RAG_PROMPT (User Prompt)**
```plaintext
CONTEXTS: {context}

QUESTION: {question}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Provide a helpful answer based on the provided contexts.
2. If the user requests a specific format (e.g., JSON, CSV), ensure the response adheres to that format.
3. If no specific format is requested, default to a concise textual answer within the JSON structure.

Helpful Answer:

Key Improvements:

    SYSTEM_PROMPT:

        Added user intent priority to ensure flexibility when users request specific formats or detailed answers.

        Clarified the fallback behavior for cases where the answer is not found.

        Simplified the rules for better readability and adherence.

    RAG_PROMPT:

        Added explicit instructions to handle user requests for specific formats.

        Ensured compatibility with the SYSTEM_PROMPT by defaulting to concise textual answers unless otherwise specified.

How They Work Together:

    The SYSTEM_PROMPT sets the overall rules and ensures consistency in formatting and citations.

    The RAG_PROMPT focuses on user intent and dynamically adjusts the response format based on the user's request.

    Together, they ensure that the system provides accurate, user-aligned responses while maintaining structured outputs and proper citations.

This optimization minimizes conflicts and ensures the pipeline works harmoniously for both concise and detailed responses.
