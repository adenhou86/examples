### üß† Suggestions for Your Agentic RAG Use:

To effectively route queries or filter documents:

* **Metadata Tags** you can infer for chunk retrieval:
  `instrument_type`, `region`, `issuer_type`, `document_type`, `risk_metrics`, `deal_name`, `counterparty`, `coverage_desk`, `regulation`.

* **Example tags for RMBS documents**:
  `{"instrument_type": "RMBS", "region": "US", "issuer_type": "non-agency", "document_type": "offering_memo", "risk_metrics": ["LTV", "FICO", "default_rate"]}`

* **Agent Tasks (per desk)**:

  * *RMBS Agent*: Summarize cash flow waterfall, extract delinquency trends.
  * *CLO Agent*: Pull tranche IRR projections, identify manager style drift.
  * *ISDA Agent*: Verify netting clauses and margin requirements.
  * *MUNI Agent*: Generate 3-year yield curve from POS.

Would you like me to help define metadata schema or RAG query templates for some of these desk types?
