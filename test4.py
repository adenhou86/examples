I've successfully run the GenAI pipeline to address the 8 questions/topics across the set of 535 NDA documents. This has produced the output file "output.xlsx," structured into four sheets as follows:

535_NDA_Data: Contains LLM-generated answers for each of the 535 documents, covering responses to all 9 categories of questions.

8_NDA_Data: Includes the LLM-generated answers specifically for the 8 NDA documents where we had the ground truth data you provided.

Performance_Summary: Provides the model's performance metrics on these 8 NDAs, achieving an accuracy rate of 97%. Performance is detailed per question type (topic).

Best_Model_Params: Lists the parameters of the best-performing model based on our evaluations.

Let me know if you need anything else or have questions regarding these results.
